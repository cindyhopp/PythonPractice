This was the second assignment as part of the Programming Fundamentals for Geographic Sciences course.

The objectives of Python scripts in this assignment were to convert temperatures between units of Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as to calculate heating degree-days in units of either Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Files include:
* [temperature.py](https://github.com/cindyhopp/PythonPractice/blob/main/Temperature_HDD/temperature.py): temperature unit conversion
* [temperature_test.py](https://github.com/cindyhopp/PythonPractice/blob/main/Temperature_HDD/temperature_test.py): unit test for the temperature module (provided by instructor with my edits)
* [climate.py](https://github.com/cindyhopp/PythonPractice/blob/main/Temperature_HDD/climate.py): heating degree-days calculation
* [climate_test.py](https://github.com/cindyhopp/PythonPractice/blob/main/Temperature_HDD/climate_test.py): unit test for the climate module (provided by instructor with my edits)
